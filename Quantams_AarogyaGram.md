## Overview


The Rural Healthcare Application is a healthcare app built in Flutter that aims to improve healthcare access and services in rural areas. In many rural areas, people face significant barriers to accessing quality healthcare services. These barriers can include long travel times, lack of healthcare facilities, and shortage of healthcare professionals. This app is designed to address some of these challenges and provide people in rural areas with access to healthcare services that are easy to use and convenient.

One of the key features of the Rural Healthcare Application is the ability to book appointments with doctors. Patients can use the app to schedule appointments with healthcare providers, and doctors can use a separate dashboard to manage their appointments. This feature is particularly useful in areas where there may be a shortage of healthcare professionals, as it enables patients to schedule appointments without having to travel long distances.

The app also provides access to health awareness videos, which can help educate users about various medical conditions, preventive measures, and treatments. This feature can be particularly useful in areas where people may have limited access to healthcare information.

Another important feature of the Rural Healthcare Application is the medication reminder system. This feature allows users to set reminders to take their medications on time, as well as track their medication history. This can be particularly useful for people with chronic conditions who may need to take medication on a regular basis.

The app also includes an emergency call system, which enables users to call for emergency services directly from the app. The app automatically sends the user's location to the emergency services, which can be particularly useful in areas where emergency services may be difficult to access.

Overall, the Rural Healthcare Application is a useful tool for improving healthcare access and services in rural areas. By providing users with easy-to-use features such as appointment booking, health awareness videos, medication reminders, and emergency call systems, the app aims to improve the health and well-being of people in rural areas.
